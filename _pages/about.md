I am an undergraduate student at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), majoring in **Chemistry** with a minor in **Computer Science**. I am interested in **drug discovery** and **artificial intelligence**. Currently, I am conducting research on artificial intelligence for drug discovery under the supervision of [Prof. Woo Youn Kim](https://wooyoun.kaist.ac.kr/). I am expected to graduate in February 2025.
Outside the lab, I enjoy taking photos, running, and watching baseball games.
